#Foreword

Well, I think I'm just feel boring or that I want to get more experience about *user experience*, so I updated *laiwang* , which Chinese's name is [来往](https://www.laiwang.com/ "laiwang"), to the latest version `4.3`. 
And as we know that laiwang is developed and published as a competitor vs wechat which is a product of Tencent inc.

**wechat** has more than *0.6 billion* registered users as is said, and **laiwang** announced having *10 million* user in mid-November 2013. 

Well, without going too deeply into their story & develop history, let's just start analysis.

#Overview
In this section, I will just give some screenshot of **wechat** and **laiwang** to express my opinion.
