# Introduction
As we know, Java has two kinds of container, `Collection` and `Map`. `Collection` is simply an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit, when `Map` is used to group `Key-Value` pair elements. The `Collection` interface has 11 subinterfaces including `List<E>`, `Set<E>`, `Queue<E>` and so on. 

Well, more information about `Collection` interface will be introducted in my new blod ~~[Collection](# "Collection")~~
