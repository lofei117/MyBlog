# Introduction
When you want to use a large object in memory, a file or some other resource that is impossible or expensive to duplicate, but you do not want to instantiate it or copy it right now cause you only need a portion information of it, you can use Proxy pattern. A proxy supplies an interface for you to do most operation of the original one, the proxy will forward them to the original object. Proxy is well known in *reference counting pointer object*.

# Definition
Provide a supporgate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

# Participants

* Proxy
	* maintains a reference that lets the proxy access the real subject. Proxy may refer to a Subject if the RealSubject and Subject interfaces are the same.
	* provides an interface identical to Subject's so that a proxy can be substituted for the real object.
	* control access to real subject and may be responsible for creating and deleting it.
	* other responsibilities depend on the kind of proxy:
		* *remote proxies* are responsible for encoding a request and its arguments and for sending the encoded request to the real subject in a different address space.
		* *virtual proxies* may cache additional information about the real subject so that they can postpone accessing it.
		* *protection proxies* check that the call has the access permissions required to perform a request.
* Subject
	* defines the interface for the RealSubject and Proxy so that a Proxy can be used anywhere a RealSubject is expected.
* RealSubject
	* defines the real object that the proxy represents.

# Example

```java
// Subject
public interface Image {
	public void draw();
}

//Proxy
public class ImageProxy implements Image {
	
	private Image realImage = null;
	
	private String fileName = null;
	
	public ImageProxy(String fileName) {
		this.fileName = fileName;
	}

	@Override
	public void draw() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		if (realImage == null) {
			realImage = new RealImage(fileName);
		}
		realImage.draw();
	}

}

// RealSubject
public class RealImage implements Image {

	private String fileName;

	public RealImage(final String fileName) {
		this.fileName = fileName;
		loadImage();
	}

	private void loadImage() {
		System.out.println("loading image:" + fileName + " from disk...");
	}

	@Override
	public void draw() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("drawing image:" + fileName);
	}

}

// Client
class Client {
	private final Image img1;
	private final Image img2;

	public Client() {
		img1 = new ImageProxy("Test_Image_1.PNG");
		img2 = new ImageProxy("Test_Image_2.PNG");
	}

	public void show() {
		img1.draw();	// need load

		img2.draw();	// need load

		img1.draw();	// do not need load

		img2.draw();	// do not need load
	}
}

public class Test {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		new Client().show();
	}

}
```

Output:

```
loading image:Test_Image_1.PNG from disk...
drawing image:Test_Image_1.PNG
loading image:Test_Image_2.PNG from disk...
drawing image:Test_Image_2.PNG
drawing image:Test_Image_1.PNG
drawing image:Test_Image_2.PNG
```

Well, it looks like [Adapter pattern](/2014/01/02/adapter/ "Adapter pattern"), an adapter provides a different interface to the object it adapts. In contrast, a proxy provides the same interface as its subject.

Decorators may have similar implementations as proxies, but decorators have a different purpose: to add one or more responsibilities to an object, whereas proxies controls the accessibilities.

# Usage

* When you need a more versatile or sophisticated reference to an object than a simple pointer.
